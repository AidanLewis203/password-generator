# password-generator

## Description
This is an application that is used to generate a random password.
It takes the problem of having to come upwith a new password and simplifies it into a few easy question to make a random password that is improbable to predict.
I learned a lot about the way a lot of different things work in JavaScript and it has helped me really hone my skills with this particular code.


## Usage
To use this application you will want to answer the prompts that come on screen to select your password lenght and what kinds of characters you want to use in your password.
Once you have selected your used characters you will click the generate password button and it will randomize characters up to your chosen password length and give you a randomly generated password.
